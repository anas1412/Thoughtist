# Thoughtist 🧠🌌

**Thoughtist** is a premium, single-file spatial productivity tool that bridges the gap between chaotic brainstorming and structured execution. It treats your ideas as physical objects in an infinite workspace, allowing you to organize thoughts organically before morphing them into a structured Kanban workflow or a scheduled Calendar.

## ✨ Core Innovations

### 1. Kinetic Information Architecture
Unlike static lists, Thoughtist uses a custom **Coulomb Physics Engine**. 
- **Universal Repulsion:** Thoughts naturally push each other away to maintain clarity.
- **Gravitational Tags:** Nodes sharing the same tags exert a "spring force," pulling related ideas into organic clusters.
- **Viscous Movement:** Physics are tuned to feel "liquid," allowing nodes to drift satisfyingly into place.

### 2. Triple-View Morphing
Seamlessly switch between three mental states:
- **Spatial Mode:** An infinite, zoomable canvas for non-linear mind mapping.
- **Kanban Mode:** A structured board (Todo/Doing/Done) that stacks nodes vertically.
- **Calendar Mode:** A month-grid view for scheduling thoughts via drag-and-drop.

### 3. Instant Creation (Smart Paste)
- **Omni-Paste:** Hit `Ctrl + V` anywhere to instantly spawn thoughts. 
- **Auto-Detection:** Pasting text creates a note; pasting an image creates a visual thought automatically.
